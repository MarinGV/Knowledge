# [HEADINGS ( # )][Headings]

To prevent compatibility issues, you should add blank lines before and after a heading.

<br>

# [PARAGRAPHS ( Blank Line )][Paragraphs]

Unless the pragraph is in a list, don’t indent paragraphs with `spaces` or `tabs`. It can result in unexpected formatting problems.

<br>

# [LINE BREAKS ( \<br> )][Line Breaks]

Although `trailing whitespaces` can be used, it is hard to notice them when reading the raw file. That's why, it is better to use the `HTML tag`.

<br>

# [EMPHASIS ( \*** *** )][Emphasis]

For compatibility, use asterisks to emphasise the middle of a word. **DO NOT** use underscore. It will act as a normal `_`.

<br>

# [BLOCKQUOTES (>)][Blockquotes]

For compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes.

<br>

# [LISTS ( 1. | -+*)][Lists]

For compatibility, use only periods `.` for ordered lists.<br>
For compatibility, don’t mix and match delimiters in the same unordered list.

<br>

# [HORIZONTAL RULE ( *** --- ___ )][Horizontal Rule]

For compatibility, put blank lines before and after horizontal rules.
